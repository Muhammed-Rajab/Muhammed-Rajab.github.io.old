    <h1 class="h1-1">Â¡Hola!, my lovely stranger!</h1>
    <p class="p-1">
      You might be here searching for my portfolio. Sorry to disappoint you,
      I've deleted it after realising that I would be much better off without
      spending an absurd amount of time building a web portfolio with the
      trendiest web technologies.
    </p>
    <p class="p-2">
      <b>But hold on for a minute!</b><br />This doesn't mean that I won't be
      upgrading this Github Page, but it won't be anything posh as you might
      expect.
    </p>

    <p class="p-3">
      If I feel like creating a portfolio one day, It wouldn't be anything more
      than some plain HTML, CSS and JS. No fancy frameworks or shit like that.
      Modern web designs have made me go back to the time when we didn't have
      all these design shit.
    </p>

    <p class="p-4">
      My opinion might piss you off, but I couldn't care any less. Don't take me
      wrong! I enjoy beautiful designs and creative ideas. I'm just sick of
      people putting a shit load of time into designing rather than providing
      any helpful content.
    </p>

    <p class="p-5">
      I hope you'll understand me. <br />
